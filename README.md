## Manhunt 2 PS2 textures for PSP
This is a PPSSPP texture pack that brings the PS2 textures to Manhunt 2's PSP version.

Some comparations are [here](https://imgsli.com/MTEzNTg3) â€” the notable difference is that most textures have 2x more resolution.

A special thanks to [Sor3nt](https://github.com/Sor3nt) for creating [Manhunt Toolkit](https://github.com/Sor3nt/manhunt-toolkit), tool that saved me a lot of time and work alongside with [FDUPES](https://github.com/adrianlopezroche/fdupes) by Adrian Lopez.
